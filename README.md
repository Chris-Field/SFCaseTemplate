# SFCaseTemplate
Chrome extension to add context menus for quickly selecting Salesforce case templates

## TODO
Format content so the case note titles are bold, but the colon at the end of each title is not bold (and thus everything typed after the title).
Create UI for users to add their own templates. Might need to create some security for this to work well.
